                <p>
                    The URI <a href="/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.1">https://archive.big-map.eu/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.1</a>
                    is used to record the fact that the submitter granted the following license to the BIG-MAP Archive
                    upon the upload and share of a dataset and corresponding metadata within a project
                    (called hereafter a “COMMUNITY”) that is part of the broader BATTERY 2030+ consortium:
                    <ul>
                    <li>
                        I grant the BIG-MAP Archive a perpetual, non-exclusive license to distribute
                        this dataset and metadata; this license is limited to distribution to current and
                        future members of the COMMUNITY.
                    </li>
                    <li>I certify that I have the right to grant this license.</li>
                    <li>
                        Current, former and future COMMUNITY members are not authorised to distribute this dataset
                        and the corresponding metadata outside the COMMUNITY in which it was originally shared.
                        The BIG-MAP Archive has no control over and is not responsible for the misuse or breach
                        of confidentiality of the dataset by one or more of the COMMUNITY members, and is not
                        responsible for any data leak or misuse.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I understand that, if  BATTERY 2030+ as a whole is selected, records are shared with all
                        current and future members of all the COMMUNITIES present in the BATTERY 2030+ consortium.
                    </li>
                    <li>I understand that the list of the members of each COMMUNITY is managed by its project
                        board of directors, or the person or persons appointed by them to accomplish the task
                        of user management, and can change over time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I understand that records cannot be completely removed once uploaded.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I understand that the BIG-MAP Archive reserves the right to reclassify or remove any record.

                        NON-LIABILITY DISCLAIMER: I understand that the services of the BIG-MAP Archive are offered
