                <h3>Can view - access to view a record</h3>
                <p>
                    To create a link with permission to view a record, the record should have been already shared with a community.</br>
                    This option is not available for a draft (a record not yet shared with a community).
                    For drafts create a link with access permission 'preview', see below.</br>
                    Proceed as follow to give access to read a record:
                    <ul>
                    <li>Select your record in <a href="/search" target="_blank">Shared records</a>. Click on the 'Share links' button.</li>
                    <li>Select 'Can view' and click on 'Create a new link'.</li>
                    <li>Click on 'Copy link' and share the link. Anyone with the link can read your record and all its shared versions and download its files.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Can preview - access to read a draft</h3>
                <p>
                    Proceed as follow to give access to read a draft:
                    <ul>
                    <li>Select your draft in <a href="/me/uploads" target="_blank">My records</a>.</li>
                    <li>Select a community and fill in all the required fields of the upload form. Save the draft.</li>
                    <li>Click on 'Preview' to check you can correctly preview the record.</li>
                    <li>Click on the 'Share links' button.</li>
                    <li>Select 'Can preview' and click on 'Create a new link'.</li>
                    <li>Click on 'Copy link' and share the link. Anyone with the link can read the draft and download its files.
                        If the draft is a new version of a previously shared record, anyone with the link can also read all the other versions of the record.
                    </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Can edit - access to edit a draft</h3>
                <p>
                    Proceed as follow to give access to edit a draft:
                    <ul>
                    <li>Select your draft in <a href="/me/uploads" target="_blank">My records</a>.</li>
                    <li>Select a community and fill in all the required fields of the upload form. Save the draft.</li>
                    <li>Click on the 'Share links' button.</li>
                    <li>Select 'Can edit' and click on 'Create a new link'.</li>
                    <li>Click on 'Copy link' and share the link. Only members of the same community the record is shared with are allowed to edit the draft.
                        If the draft is a new version of a previously shared record or an update of the shared record, with the same link it is possible to also edit
                        all the other versions of the record or create a new version. Only the owner of the record can share the record update or new version with a community.
                    </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
