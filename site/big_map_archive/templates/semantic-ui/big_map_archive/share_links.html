            <div>
                You can create links to give access to other people (other than the record owner) to view a record, view a draft (preview) or edit a draft.</br>
                Note that a link gives access (with the selected permission) to any version of a record.</br>
                Nevertheless, only the owner of the record can share the record with a community and can create or delete the record access links.
            </div>

                <h3>Can view: access to view a record</h3>
                <p>
                    To create a link with permission to view a record (read only), the record should be already shared with a community.</br>
                    This option is not available for a draft. Instead, for drafts create a link with access permission 'preview', see below.</br>
                    Note that the same link gives access to all versions of a record.
                    Note also that anyone with the link will be able to view the record, even if they do not have a BIG-MAP Archive account.</br>
                    Proceed as follows to give access to read a record:
                    <ul>
                    <li>Select your record in <a href="/search" target="_blank">Shared records</a>. Click on the 'Share links' button.</li>
                    <li>Select 'Can view' and click on 'Create a new link'.</li>
                    <li>Click on 'Copy link' and share the copied link with anyone who should be able to read your record (and all its versions).</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Can preview: access to read a draft</h3>
                <p>
                    Proceed as follows to give access to read a draft:
                    <ul>
                    <li>Select your draft in <a href="/me/uploads" target="_blank">My records</a>.</li>
                    <li>Select a community and fill in all the required fields of the upload form. Save the draft.</li>
                    <li>Click on 'Preview' to check that you can preview the record.</li>
                    <li>Click on the 'Share links' button.</li>
                    <li>Select 'Can preview' and click on 'Create a new link'.</li>
                    <li>Click on 'Copy link' and share the copied link with anyone who should be able to read your draft and download its files.
                        If the draft is a new version of a previously shared record, note that anyone with the link can also read all the other versions of the record.
                    </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Can edit: access to edit a draft</h3>
                <p>
                    Proceed as follows to give access to edit a draft:
                    <ul>
                    <li>Select your draft in <a href="/me/uploads" target="_blank">My records</a>.</li>
                    <li>Select a community and fill in all the required fields of the upload form. Save the draft.</li>
                    <li>Click on the 'Share links' button.</li>
                    <li>Select 'Can edit' and click on 'Create a new link'.</li>
                    <li>Click on 'Copy link' and share the copied link with anyone who should be able to edit your draft. Note that only logged-in members who also belong to the same community the record is shared with are allowed to edit the draft.
                        Note also that if the draft is a new version of a previously shared record or an update of a shared record, the same link gives permission to edit
                        all versions of the record and to create a new version. Nevertheless, only the owner of the record can share the record with a community.
                    </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
