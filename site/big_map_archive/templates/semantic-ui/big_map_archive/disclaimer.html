                In the BIG-MAP Archive, data is always shared within a project (called hereafter a “COMMUNITY”)
                that is part of the broader BATTERY 2030+ consortium. An additional COMMUNITY is also available
                to share data with the BATTERY 2030+ consortium as a whole. The list of the members of each
                COMMUNITY is managed by its project board of directors, or the person or persons appointed by
                them to accomplish the task of user management, and can change over time.
                </p>
                <p>
                Current, former and future COMMUNITY members are not authorised to distribute any records datasets
                and the corresponding metadata outside the COMMUNITY in which the records were originally shared.
                The BIG-MAP Archive has no control over and is not responsible for the misuse or breach of
                confidentiality of the datasets by one or more of the COMMUNITY members, and is not responsible
                for any data leak or misuse.
